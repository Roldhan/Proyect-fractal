# Proyect-fractal
fractal project, is the code name of what would be a new social network much more useful in our lives and that would contribute enormously to the development and ease of things.  I understand in part! but!! What is it really? It will be a social messaging application, but not like the one we are used to seeing. if not go much further, consist with video calls in real time in which we can add groups and at the same time share a video and that can see at the same time all, ie a small home theater, which you can see and share multimedia, videos, gif, imajenes etc, in real time.  but it will not remain ahy as it will evolve and adapt more to our daily life and facilitating our leisure more.  also later on, as it evolves, it will also be present in companies, businesses, etc., and this will be part of our daily life.
